# SQL-Project---Movies-Dataset-

Objective - This project to analyze the movies dataset available with various tables. Using the SQL queries for Data Manipulation. The main objective of querying this database is to practice and efficiently use SQL syntax in asking questions and producing desired results.

I have just completed my first SQL project. This project showcases SQL syntaxes that I have learned in the last few weeks since beginning my journey to becoming a Data Analyst. The project was executed with MySQL. Here I analysed SQL dataset of movies. This dataset was obtained from GitHub. This dataset was chosen because it contains all of the necessary tables and will allow me to run basic to intermediate queries. In the database, there are 09 tables. I included the questions for which I planned to query the database.
